                <p>The number nine is a very iconic element in the<br/> 
                Daytoner universe.Nine is an amazing and very <br/>
                unique number culturally but also mathematically. <br/>
                In some way nine is the highest of all numbers,<br/>
                because everything after that is just<br/>
                combinations of lower numbers. In that sense it<br/>
                symbolises a final frontier. The digital space<br/>
                gives us the chance to explore M9E designs that<br/>
                are not physically manufacturable and opens up<br/>
                possibilities to sell digital and maybe even<br/>
                physical one offsinspired by those new M9E creations.</p>
